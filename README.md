## Getting Started

To get started with these implementations, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/neural-networks-implementations.git
cd neural-networks-implementations`
```

### Requirements

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

-   Python 3.x
-   PyTorch
-   TensorFlow
-   NumPy
-   Matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash

`pip install torch tensorflow numpy matplotlib`

Usage
-----

Each script is standalone and can be run individually. For example, to run the PyTorch autoencoder implementation:

bash

Copy code

`python autoencoder_torch.py`

Or to run the TensorFlow cats vs. dogs classifier:

bash

Copy code

`python cats_tf.py`
